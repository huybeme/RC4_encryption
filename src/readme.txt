COMP596: Cryptography (Spring 21)
Homework Assignment 2 - Problem 4

Please run main.java for a hard code with pre-defined key and plain text for an encrypted message.


Or

(optional) run RC4_main.java for an interactive program that will return/print a string of encrypted plain text.
Something I tried to write for more programming practice.

note: if other programs are used to for decryption on main.java, it may not be compatible since other programs seem to
do pseudo random code generation algorithm in a single cycle. main.java is written to run two cycles for higher security
as noted on the slides.
